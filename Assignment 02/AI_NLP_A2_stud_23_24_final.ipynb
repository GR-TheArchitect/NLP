lecture.*\n","\n","So how do we find the path with the highest score? The idea is that we can use our trellis to represent an **exponential number of paths**. Since we are only interested in the highest-scoring path, for every state at every time step, we only need to keep track of the **highest** probability that can lead us to that state. We can disregard any other paths that lead to that state, since they will for sure not be part of the highest-scoring path.\n","\n","Viterbi uses **dynamic programming**. Here, that means that we will re-use probabilities that we have already computed, so we never have to compute the score for the same sub-problem multiple times.\n","\n","Let's start at the beginning.\n","\n","For the first time step, the **viterbi score** is the transition probability of reaching a state $s_k$ from \"start\", times the probability of emitting the first observation $o_1$ from that state:\n","\n","$$\\text{viterbi}(1, s_k) = P_{\\text start}( s_k \\,|\\, \\text{start}) \\times P_{\\text emiss}(o_1 \\,|\\, s_k)$$\n","\n","So, the Viterbi trellis represents the path with maximum probability in position $i$ when we are in state $y_i$ having observed $o_1, o_2, \\dots, o_i$, the observations up to and including that point.\n","\n","Now that we have the viterbi scores for all states of the first time step in our trellis, we can use the following **recursive formula** to get the scores for all other states, one time step at a time:\n","\n","$$\\text{viterbi}(i, s_k) = \\big( \\max_{s_l \\in \\Lambda} P_{\\text trans}(s_k | s_l) \\times \\text{viterbi}(i-1, s_l) \\big) \\times P_{\\text emiss}(o_i \\,|\\, s_k)$$\n","\n","Finally, for our final state \"stop\" we need to do something special, since there is no observation there:\n","\n","$$\\text{viterbi}(N+1, \\text{stop}) = \\max_{s_l \\in \\Lambda} P_{\\text stop}(\\text{stop} \\,|\\, s_l) \\times \\text{viterbi}(i-1, s_l)  $$\n","\n","This is all we need to know what probability the highest scoring path has! Do you see how the dynamic programming helps us to solve this task efficiently?\n","\n","## How did we get here?\n","\n","Once we reach the \"stop\" state we know the maximum probability, but we forgot how we got there! If you don't see this immediately, remember that, whenever we computed the viterbi score for a state, we took the maximum over all previous states' viterbi scores, times the transition from those states. But we didn't keep track of which state was actually selected in that \"max\" operation. So now that we are in \"stop\", we don't know how we got there.\n","\n","To solve this, we will use **backpointers**. Whenever we do a $\\max$, we store what state was selected by that max (i.e. the $\\arg\\max$):\n","\n","$$\\text{backtrack}(i, s_k) = \\arg\\max_{s_l \\in \\Lambda} P_{\\text trans}(s_k | s_l) \\times \\text{viterbi}(i-1, s_l)$$\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RFlBQv_74cbW"},"source":["## From probabilities to log-probabilities"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"AGEiDOw0iYaW"},"source":["Now you know enough to implement Viterbi!
